<h3>The Law of the Vital Few</h3>
<p>In 1906 economist Vilfredo Pareto was studying land ownership in Italy and found that 20 percent of the people owned 80 percent of the land. The remaining 80 percent of the people owned the other 20 percent. Around the same time, he had noticed that 80 percent of his pea harvest came from 20 percent of the pods. He began to see that this ratio held in other areas, as well.</p>
<p>This 80/20 rule got more attention in the 1940s when “quality management” founder Joseph Juran began looking at manufacturing through Pareto’s lens. Juran found that in manufacturing 20 percent of causes created 80 percent of the defects. He described the “Pareto Principle,” but preferred to call it the “Law of the Vital Few.” Distribution of most things is unequal, and the “vital few” have high impact while the “trivial many” have little impact.</p>
