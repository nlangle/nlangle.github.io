<h2 id="wlbr">How to work less, get better results</h2>
<p>Imagine having a couple extra hours of free time a day. Wouldn’t it be nice.<br />
  Work-life balance would shift favorably, you’d be more relaxed and you’d probably love your job more.
</p>
<p>
  But wait, you might say, if I work less I’d get less done and my boss will really not be happy and my performance will fall and I’ll get fired and…. Wrong.
</p>
<h4>The myth of the 8-hour workday.</h4>
<p>
  Here is the core misconception that makes so many of us unhappy. Working eight to 12 hours a day will not give you better results, it’ll just wear you down and make you spend your time waiting for the weekend or holidays so you could sleep.
</p>
<p>
  Still, according to official statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American works 8.8 hours every day.
</p>
<p>
  The roots of the 40-hour workweek are in the industrial era. It was Robert Owen who started using the slogan:
</p>
<blockquote><p style="font-style: italic;">Eight hours labor, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest.</p></blockquote>
<p>A little while later Ford implemented it in their factories, increased their revenue and productivity and it became an industry standard. A standard that is now a century old.</p>
<p>Surely, we can say that a lot has changed over the last 100 years. We’ve thrown out a ton of standards in that time, surely, we can throw out one more.</p>
<h4>Less really is more.</h4>
<p>Studies show that working less and staying more concentrated <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leonhard-widrich/the-origin-of-the-8-hour-_b_4524488.html" target="_blank">yields much higher results</a> and allows you to stay productive for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>To work less, there’s actually just one thing you need to achieve. You must eliminate fake work from your daily routine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/252998" target="_blank">Fake work </a>is a loose term for everything that we call work but is actually pretty useless.</p>
<p>This includes the five minute breaks in Facebook some people take every 10 minutes (the fact that you work as a social marketer does not give you the right to spend time like’ing your cousin’s new pictures) but fake work also includes everything we do that might be part of our job description but doesn’t actually help us achieve our overall goals.</p>
<p>Remember those strategy meetings where you just sat and listened? That was fake work and you could&nbsp;have achieved just as much by spending that time catching Pokemon.</p>
<h4>Our everyday fakeness.</h4>
<p>We’re all doing fake work to some degree. These are those small and easy tasks that give as some sense of accomplishment, give us the feeling that we’re working but actually doesn’t move as towards our long term goals.</p>
<p>So to identify fake work and get it out of our lives we first need to have clear goals.</p>
<p>Having clear and specific goals for employees and companies sounds like a very normal thing to have. Every job and position has goals… in theory.</p>
<p>The reality is that a lot of companies only have general goals like “increase revenue”. But how will the company achieve it? What is the time-frame? Honestly, who cares?</p>
<p>And so, everyone does something that may or may not help to get closer to the goals. And you’ll have so much fake work, you’ll be sick.</p>
<p>What you need to do is to set <a href="https://blog.weekdone.com/setting-smart-goals-to-achieve-success-infographic/" target="_blank">SMART goals</a>.</p>
<h4>Focus on the impactful.</h4>
<p>SMART is an acronym for:</p>
<ul class="list-style-type-none">
  <li>Specific.</li>
  <li>Measurable.</li>
  <li>Achievable.</li>
  <li>Relevant.</li>
  <li>Time-bound.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific and measurable goals are easier to understand and allow employees to focus on tasks that really bring forth the desired results.</p>
<p>A example of a SMART goal could be to increase revenue by 20 percent next quarter by increasing <a href="http://thenextweb.com/topic/ios/" target="_blank" title="Read more about iOS.">iOS</a> app sales.</p>
<p>The morale here is: Plan more, work smart, get better results.</p>
<p>This point is further enforced by the <a href="http://management.about.com/cs/generalmanagement/a/Pareto081202.htm" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a>. It says that “80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of our work.”</p>
<p>So to work less, we need to determine what that 20 percent is that we actually have to do? SMART goals will allow you to do just that.</p>
<h4>Lifehacks for productivity.</h4>
<p>When you’ve eliminated everything you don’t need to do, you can focus on ways to increase your efficiency while doing the important tasks.</p>
<p>The internet is full of lifehacks that give you tips to help you work better. I’ll just mention a few of them that I use the most (you can Google the rest).</p>
<p>The first 90 minutes’ rule. Start your day by spending the first 90 minutes on the most important task.</p>
<p>Have no distractions. You’re fresh and focused in the morning, even if you don’t feel it. So if you can resist the urge to have a coffee break at 9:30, you’ll have something important done by 10:30.</p>
<p>That’ll give you a positive feeling for the remaining day. Also, that’s pretty much how this article was written.</p>
<p>A focused work rule is also important. So spend the rest of your day by working intensely for 55 to 60 minutes and then take a 10 minute break during which you don’t deal with work at all.</p>
<p>Listen to some music, have a walk, enjoy some water-cooler talk, and in 10 minutes you’ll be ready to dive in again.</p>
<p>I like to spend these breaks playing darts or pool, but walking around and humming my favorite songs works just as well.</p>
<p>Finally, track your daily progress and plan each week in advance.</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://weekdone.com/resources/#ppp" target="_blank">PPP (Plans, Progress, Problems)</a> methodology. Spend 10 minutes at the end of the week to set five to six&nbsp;big tasks for the next week (things you’ll do with your first 90 minutes). When things get done, move them to Progress.</p>
<p>The idea here is to always know what you’ll be doing the next day. Even dreadful Monday mornings are easier, when you arrive to work with clear goal in mind and without needing to spend the first three hours figuring out, what’s going on.</p>
<p>You can use a status reporting tool like <a href="https://weekdone.com/?utm_source=guest&amp;utm_medium=tnw&amp;utm_campaign=weekdonecom" target="_blank">Weekdone</a><a href="https://index.co/company/weekdone?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hover-weekdone" data-index="" target="_blank"></a> to keep track of your goals and report them to your superiors. It’ll also help you set and link your SMART goals so you can make sure none of your tasks are fake work.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you have to remember what’s important: Results. As many leaders still don’t understand it, spread the word. Chance your mindset. And following the tips written here, you should be able to make sure the end of the day is at least a few hours earlier.</p>

<h2 id="ppp">PPP: Plans, Progress, Problems</h2>
<div class="">
  <div class="">
    <h4 class="">What is it? </h4>
    <p>Progress, plans, problems (PPP) is a management technique for recurring (daily, weekly or monthly) status reporting. <br>
      Each person reports usually 3-5 key achievements, goals and challenges - called progress, plans and problems - from the reporting period. <br>
      It is used in organizations in situations like employee to manager, team member to team or CEO to board, investors and advisors reporting.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="">
  <div class="">
    <h4 class="">Structure </h4>
    <p>PPP template is very simple, consisting of 3 categories: </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Progress.</b> Employee's accomplishments, finished items and closed tasks for the period ending.</li>
      <li><b>Plans.</b> Goals and objectives for the next reporting period. These should become Progress next week.</li>
      <li><b>Problems.</b> Challenges. Items that are stuck and can.t be finished. Problems often need help from someone else, not just the employee.</li>
    </ol>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="">
  <div class="">
    <h4 class="">Benefits</h4>
    <p>PPP is really simple to use and as such does not take much time to neither fill in nor to read. <br>
      Having weekly or monthly PPP reports at hand can save hours of time from useless meetings.<br>
      It's often loved by both leaders and managers as well as team members finding out how their co-workers are doing.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="">
  <div class="">
    <h4 class="">When to use PPP? </h4>
    <p>If you don't know which status report template or process you need, PPP is the de facto standard to start from. <br>
      You can always add categories or sections later.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="">
  <div class="">
    <h4 class="">Used by </h4>
    <p>Companies like Skype, Ebay and Facebook. Startup accelerators like Seedcamp. Many technology companies.

<h2 id="rethink">The Origin of the 8 Hour Work Day and Why We Should Rethink It</h2>

<p>
  One of the most unchanged elements of our life today is our optimal work time or how long we should work — generally, every person I’ve spoken to quotes me something close to 8 hours a day.
</p>
<p>
And data seems to confirm that: The average American works 8.8 hours every day. At least, those are the

<a href="http://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/" rel="nofollow">official statistics</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics:
</p>
<p><img alt="average work time - optimal work time" src="http://blog.bufferapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PIC-1.gif" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>And yet, for most of us it is obvious that knowing how long the average person works every day has little to do with how efficient or productive that pattern is. At least, that is what I personally found for my own productivity. So what’s the the right hourly rate?</p>

<p>With success stories from people working 4 hours a week, to 16 hours a day, it’s hard to know if there is an optimal amount. So instead of going with my gut, which often fails me, I thought of looking into <strong>actual research on work time and how to optimize it for your happiness and success</strong>.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Why do we have 8 hour work days in the first place?</h4>
<br>
<p>
Let’s start out with what we have right now. The typical work day is around 8 hours. But how did we come up with that? The answer is hidden in <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/05/why-a-typical-work-day-is-eight-hours-long/" rel="nofollow" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:1,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/05/why-a-typical-work-day-is-eight-hours-long/&quot;}}">the tidings of the Industrial revolution</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, when companies started to maximize the output of their factories, getting to running them 24/7 was key. Now of course, to make things more efficient, people had to work more. In fact, 10-16 hour days were the norm.
</p>
<p>These incredibly long work days weren’t sustainable and soon a brave man called Robert Owen started a campaign to have people work no more than 8 hours per day.&nbsp; His slogan was <strong>“Eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest.”&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
  It wasn’t until much later that Ford actually implemented the 8 hour work day and changed the standards:
</p>
<p>One of the first businesses to implement this was the Ford Motor Company, in 1914, which not only cut the standard work day to eight hours, but also doubled their worker’s pay in the process.&nbsp; To the shock of many industries, this resulted in Ford’s productivity off of these same workers, but with fewer hours, actually increasing significantly and Ford’s profit margins doubled within two years.&nbsp; This encouraged other companies to adopt the shorter, eight hour work day as a standard for their employees.
</p>
<p>So there we have it. The reason we work 8 hours a day, isn’t scientific or much thought out. It’s purely a century old norm for running factories most efficiently.
</p>
<h4>Manage energy not time: How long we work isn’t important &amp; the Ultradian Rhythm</h4>
<p><br>
Without wanting to fall into the same trap, it’s time to ask a better question. How many hours we work every day is barely important in today’s creative economy.
</p>
<p>Instead, the right focus is your energy, according to famous author Tony Schwartz:<br>
“Manage your energy, not your time.”
</p>
<p>Schwartz explains that as humans we have four different types of energies to manage every day:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your physical energy — how healthy are you?&nbsp;(We’ve written about that part before)</li>
	<li>Your emotional energy — how happy are you?</li>
	<li><b>Your mental energy — how well can you focus on something?</b></li>
	<li>Your spiritual energy — why are you doing all of this? What is your purpose?</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the things most of us easily forget is that as humans, we are distinctly different from machines. <strong>At the core, this means that machines move linearly and humans move cyclically.</strong></p></div>
For an efficient work day, that truly respects our human nature, the first thing to focus on are ultradian cycles.
<p>The basic understanding is that <strong>our human minds can focus on any given task for 90-120 minutes</strong>. Afterwards, a 20-30 minute break is required for us to get the renewal to achieve high performance for our next task again. Here is a better representation of the ultradian rhythm:
</p>
<p><img alt="optimal work time, ultradian rhythm" src="http://blog.bufferapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PIC-3.jpg" width="432" height="301"></p>
<p>So instead of thinking about “What can I get done in an 8 hour day,” I’ve started to change my thinking to <strong>“What can I get done in a 90 min session”</strong>.
</p>
<p>Now that we know we got to split everything in 90 min chunks, it’s time to break down those 90 minutes sessions further.
</p>

</h4>
<p>The one most crucial to understanding our workflows is how well we can focus. In a stunning research project Justin Gardner <a href="http://www.riken.jp/engn/r-world/info/release/press/2011/111208/index.html" rel="nofollow" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:3,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://www.riken.jp/engn/r-world/info/release/press/2011/111208/index.html&quot;}}">found</a> that to actually focus on something our brain uses a 2-step process:
</p>
<p>1.)&nbsp; <strong>“Sensitivity enhancement”:</strong> It means you see a scene or setup and take all the information in that is presented. Then you focus in on what needs your attention. Kind of like “a blurry photo that slowly starts to come into focus”, describes <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5895509/train-your-brain-for-monk+like-focus" rel="nofollow" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:4,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5895509/train-your-brain-for-monk+like-focus&quot;}}">Lifehacker</a>.
</p>
<p>
2.)&nbsp; <strong>“Efficient selection”: &nbsp;</strong>This is now the actual zooming in on a task happens. This allows us to enter into what Mihály Csíkszentmihályi calls <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow" data-new-link="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Flow_(psychology)" data-noreplace="1">“Flow” state</a>. Now our actual work on a task happens.
</p>
<p>The follow figure probably describes it best:</p>
<p><img alt="optimal work time, multitasking" src="http://blog.bufferapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PIC-4.png" width="668" height="610"><b>&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p><strong>In figure A, as our brain is presented with only 1 task, we are able to separate out distractors (blue) from what’s actually important (yellow).</strong>
</p>
<p>In figure B, as we are presented with multiple tasks at once, our brain is increasingly easy to distract and combines the actual tasks with distractors.
</p>
<p>The key conclusion that Gardner suggests from his study is that we have to both:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Stop multitasking to avoid being distracted in our work environment.</li>
	<li>Eliminate distractors even when only 1 task is present</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sounds fairly obvious right? And yet, getting it actually done every day is much easier said then done. The good news is that after all, we can even actually change our brain structure from learning to focus. Here are some hands on tips:
</p>
<h4>The top 4 tips for improving your work day:</h4>
<p>
For my daily workflow at <a href="http://bufferapp.com" rel="nofollow">Buffer</a>, I’ve started to make 4 distinct changes to implement the above research better. Here is what worked the best:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<strong>Manually increase the relevance of a task</strong>: Now, a lot of us still might struggle to find the focus, especially if no one set a deadline to it. <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/27/8726" rel="nofollow" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:5,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/27/8726&quot;}}">Overriding your attention system</a>, and <strong>adding your own deadline together with a reward</strong> has shown some of the most significant improvements for task completion according to researcher Keisuke Fukuda.<b>&nbsp;</b>
</li>
	<li>
<strong>Split your day into 90 min windows:</strong> Here is something I’ve started to do. Instead of looking at a 8, 6 or 10 hour work day, split it down and say you’ve got 4, 5 or however many 90 minute windows. That way you will be able to have 4 tasks that you can get done every day much more easily.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plan your rest so you actually rest: </strong>“The fittest person is not the one who runs the fastest, but the one who has optimized their rest time.” Says Tony Schwartz. A lot of the time, we are so busy planning our work day, that we forget about “how” to rest. Plan beforehand what you will do your rest. Here are some ideas: Nap, read, meditate, get a snack.</li>
<li>
<b>&nbsp;</b><strong>Zero notifications: </strong>One of the best ideas I’ve ever had was to follow <a href="http://joel.is/post/39927202947/zero-notifications" rel="nofollow" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:6,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://joel.is/post/39927202947/zero-notifications&quot;}}">Joel’s advice on Zero Notifications</a>. Having absolutely no counter on my phone or computer changing from 0 to 1 and always breaking my focus has been a huge help. If you haven’t tried this yet, try to <strong>turn off every digital element that could become an alert.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, my life has been pretty much turned upside down after implementing these findings over the past few weeks. And I couldn’t be happier. I get both more done and feel happier at the same time.
</p>
