<h1>Atomic Design</h1>
<p>good info on how to build using the atomic design concept</p>
<b>What is it?</b>
<p>break down website compenents into a basic design system with modular parts that work together</p>
<ul>
  <ol>
    <h3>atoms</h3>
    <p>Atoms are the basic building blocks of any particular app. These are usually semantic HTML elements, and they are the only atomic element that is not normally a container. Like atoms in the real world, these should represent the smallest possible component within which it wouldn’t make sense to abstract further. Think a Reply button that is simply some text and an icon and some styles. Together they compose the various other atomic components like organisms or molecules.</p>

  <ol>
    <h3>molecules</h3>
    <p>Molecules are groups of elements describing a static piece of an interface, such as a group of shared UI elements like a grouping that includes a like button, share button, bookmark button, etc.<br />Although they can appear anywhere in the hierarchy, molecules are most often found within repeating organisms.</p>

  </ol>
  <ol>
    <h3>organisms</h3>
    <p>Organisms are really the core component of any dynamic web application, these components represent dynamic containers of information that repeat consistently across a UI. Think tweet boxes, material cards, etc. Anything that is a repeating, dynamic container.</p>

  </ol>
  <ol>
    <h3>ecosystem</h3>
    <p>Ecosystems should represent the major core container components and ideas the interface is trying to communicate — this also provides an isolated outer context for styles.<br />If you are using Redux for your data-management (which you should be), ecosystems are what would possibly be your Smart Components, facilitating communication between each other on an ecosystem-to-ecosystem level.<br />Responsible for both handling the data reduced via redux as well as delegating the manipulated state through its child organisms, molecules, and atoms as stateless functional components.</p>

  </ol>
  <ol>
    <h3>environment</h3>
    <p>Environments correspond to whole views or ‘pages’. If you are making an app that is either static, or has entirely separate views on separate routes, you’d have multiple environments.</p>
