<h1>Branding</h1>

<p>the beginning of some branding tools and tricks</p>

<h3>Typography & Text Styles</h3>
<p>based on using 4 sub-types</p>
<ul>
  <li>default (80 - 100% transparency)</li>
  <li>secondary (50 - 70% transparency)</li>
  <li>disabled (20 - 40% transparency)</li>
  <li>accent (usually brand primary color)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a neat little trick to ensure that your text looks great over any background color. In the image below, the transparency (second line) looks much better than the grey (first line) because it has taken on the hue of the color below it. There are no tricks; the second line of text is the exact same in each color scenario. It’s just the transparency working for you that makes them look like different text styles. All for the price of one. How convenient!</p>
